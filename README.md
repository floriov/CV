## Vanessa Florio

I am a highly motivated and ambitious full-stack software engineer who enjoys to solve problems, think analytically, and aims to extend my programming knowledge further.

After obtaining a bachelor's degree at the University of Warwick and a master's degree at University College London (UCL), I spent a year working in financial audit at a Big4 firm in London. Whilst I was still working full time, I enjoyed working on small coding projects and completing courses on Codecademy in my freetime, which made me discover my passion for programming. I am currently completing a 12-week coding bootcamp at Makers Academy, with the aim of starting a career as a software engineer.
