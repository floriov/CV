I am a highly motivated and ambitious full-stack software engineer who enjoys to solve problems, think analytically, and aims to extend their programming knowledge further.

After obtaining a bachelor's degree at the University of Warwick and a master's degree at University College London (UCL), I started working as a financial auditor at a Big4 firm in London. Whilst I was still working full time, I enjoyed working on small coding projects and completing courses on Codecademy in my free time, which made me discover my passion for programming. 

As a Makers Graduate, I am looking forward to the new challenge of developing my craft, building meaningful products and solving interesting problems each day. I am excited to bring my passion and curiosity to a team that I can learn from and grow with.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Heroku, Github Actions (CI/CD)
